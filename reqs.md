Below is a structured outline of the **server** and **client** functionalities divided into their respective roles, with functions required for implementation and step-by-step operation for each:

---

### **Server Roles and Functions**
The server acts as the auctioneer and coordinator for the bidding process.

#### **1. Initialize Auction**
**Function**: `initialize_auction()`
- **Steps**:
  1. Randomly create a list of items with initial bidding prices and total available units for each item.
  2. Store item details in a data structure (e.g., a dictionary or database) with fields for:
     - Item name
     - Starting price
     - Current highest bid
     - Remaining units
  3. Display the initial list of items with their prices and units.

#### **2. Broadcast Items for Bidding**
**Function**: `broadcast_items()`
- **Steps**:
  1. Send available item details to all connected clients.
  2. Include the item name, current highest bid, and remaining units in the message.

#### **3. Receive Bids**
**Function**: `receive_bids()`
- **Steps**:
  1. Wait for a set duration (e.g., 1 minute) to collect bids from clients.
  2. Store received bids in a queue or list, including:
     - Client ID
     - Item name
     - Bid amount

#### **4. Decide Winner**
**Function**: `decide_winner()`
- **Steps**:
  1. For each item, sort bids received during the bidding period in descending order of bid amount.
  2. Select the highest bid and mark the client as the winner for one unit of the item.
  3. Deduct one unit from the item's available quantity.
  4. Update the current highest bid for the item.

#### **5. Notify Clients**
**Function**: `notify_clients()`
- **Steps**:
  1. Notify the winning client of their successful bid.
  2. Inform all clients of the new highest bid for each item.
  3. If an item is sold out, remove it from the bidding broadcast.

#### **6. Manage Auction Process**
**Function**: `manage_auction()`
- **Steps**:
  1. Continuously invite bids for items with remaining units.
  2. Stop the auction when all units of all items are sold out.
  3. Display major events, including:
     - Start of a new bidding round
     - Winning bid for each item
     - Final status of items sold.

### **Client Roles and Functions**
The client acts as a bidder in the auction.

#### **1. Connect to Server**
**Function**: `connect_to_server()`
- **Steps**:
  1. Establish a TCP connection to the server.
  2. Receive item details (name, starting price, remaining units).

#### **2. Receive Auction Updates**
**Function**: `receive_updates()`
- **Steps**:
  1. Listen for broadcast messages from the server.
  2. Parse the broadcast to update local data about items, current bids, and units available.

#### **3. Make a Bid**
**Function**: `make_bid()`
- **Steps**:
  1. Randomly decide whether to participate in the current bidding round (70% chance to bid).
  2. Randomly select an item to bid on from the available items.
  3. Generate a bid amount higher than the current highest bid but within the clientâ€™s maximum acceptable price.
  4. Submit the bid to the server.

#### **4. Process Bid Results**
**Function**: `process_results()`
- **Steps**:
  1. Wait for the server's response about the bidding outcome.
  2. If the client wins, update its list of purchased items and remaining budget.
  3. If the client loses, decide whether to increase the bid or stop bidding for that item (based on the max price limit).

#### **5. Display Results**
**Function**: `display_results()`
- **Steps**:
  1. Display major events such as:
     - Items successfully purchased
     - Winning bids
     - Items not bid on or lost.

#### **6. Repeat Bidding Process**
**Function**: `repeat_bidding()`
- **Steps**:
  1. Continue to participate in bidding rounds until all items are sold out or the program is externally terminated.

### **Execution Flow**
1. **Server**: Initializes items and starts the auction.
2. **Clients**: Connect to the server and wait for updates.
3. **Server**: Broadcasts items and invites bids.
4. **Clients**: Decide whether to bid, generate a bid, and submit it.
5. **Server**: Receives bids, decides winners, and notifies clients.
6. **Clients**: Process results and decide next actions.
7. The cycle repeats until all items are sold.

This structure ensures modular, synchronized, and efficient handling of the auction process.
